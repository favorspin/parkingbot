# ParkingBot

ParkingBot is a Slack application that allows you to notify the owner of a car that you are blocked in and need them to move.

## Dependencies
- Node 12.14.1
- PostgreSQL

## Install
For local testing, set up a `.env` file in the root directory, containing your required environment variables. The following are required for local development:

- PORT
- DATABASE_URL
- PARKINGBOT_COMMAND\_TOKEN
- SLACK_TOKEN

For produciton, create your environment variables on the server. The following are required in production:

- DATABASE_URL
- NODE_ENV
- PARKINGBOT_COMMAND\_TOKEN
- SLACK_TOKEN

Tokens are provided by Slack when you install an app in your workspace. When installing an app on Slack the following slash commands will need to be set:

`/parking` -> /commands/parkingbot</br>
`/move` -> /commands/parkingbot

Finally the following permissions will need to be assigned to the app under OAuth & Permissions in the Slack App dashboard:

    channels:read
    chat:write
    commands
    im:write

**Run:**

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

## API / Testing
Note: local dev will require you to create a webserver and point Slack slash commands to that URL.

**Commands**</br>
Slash Commands from Slack send a `POST` message to their assigned route with a payload containing some information regarding the user, workpace, channel and command message sent. An example is provided below. The following routes define
